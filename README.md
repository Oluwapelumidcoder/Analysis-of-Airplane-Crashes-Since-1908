# Analysis-of-Airplane-Crashes-Since-1908
The project is one of my capstone projects to signify my completion of the Microsoft 30 days of learning bootcamp.

----
# Project Objective
The objective of the project is to analyze airplane crashes since 1908 and draw meaningful insights from the data.

----
# Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was collected from kaggle. The link to the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908

----
# Data Transformation
1) The data was sourced online from kaggle and then imported for analysis on PowerBI.
2) Then I did a couple of data cleaning on power query  to make the data easy to use. I removed unnecessary columns, separated the date column by creating a new column to reflect the weekdays. I also made some changes to the data formats to make sure they are in the right formats.
3) After this, I analyzed the data to draw meaningful insights from it.
4) Finally I created some comprehendible visualizations.
